	abstract = {Massive black hole binaries (MBHBs) are expected to form at the centre of merging galaxies during the hierarchical assembly of the cosmic structure, and are expected to be the loudest sources of gravitational waves (GWs) in the low frequency domain. However, because of the dearth of energy exchanges with background stars and gas, many of these MBHBs may stall at separations too large for GW emission to drive them to coalescence in less than a Hubble time. Triple MBH systems are then bound to form after a further galaxy merger, triggering a complex and rich dynamics that can eventually lead to MBH coalescence. Here we report on the results of a large set of numerical simulations, where MBH triplets are set in spherical stellar potentials and MBH dynamics is followed through 2.5 post-Newtonian order in the equations of motion. From our full suite of simulated systems we find that a fraction \${\textbackslash}simeq 20-30\$\% of the MBH binaries that would otherwise stall are led to coalesce within a Hubble time. The corresponding coalescence timescale peaks around 300 Myr, while the eccentricity close to the plunge, albeit small, is non-negligible (\${\textbackslash}lesssim 0.1\$). We construct and discuss marginalised probability distributions of the main parameters involved and, in a companion paper of the series, we will use the results presented here to forecast the contribution of MBH triplets to the GW signal in the nHz regime probed by Pulsar Timing Array experiments.},

	abstract = {Massive black-hole binaries (MBHBs) are thought to be the main source of gravitational waves (GWs) in the low-frequency domain surveyed by ongoing and forthcoming Pulsar Timing Array campaigns and future space-borne missions, such as \{{\textbackslash}it eLISA\}. However, many low-redshift MBHBs in realistic astrophysical environments may not reach separations small enough to allow significant GW emission, but rather stall on (sub)pc-scale orbits. This "last-parsec problem" can be eased by the appearance of a third massive black hole (MBH) -- the "intruder" -- whose action can force, under certain conditions, the inner MBHB on a very eccentric orbit, hence allowing intense GW emission eventually leading to coalescence. A detailed assessment of the process, ultimately driven by the induced Kozai-Lidov oscillations of the MBHB orbit, requires a general relativistic treatment and the inclusion of external factors, such as the Newtonian precession of the intruder orbit in the galactic potential and its hardening by scattering off background stars. In order to tackle this problem, we developed a three-body Post-Newtonian (PN) code framed in a realistic galactic potential, including both non-dissipative 1PN and 2PN terms, and dissipative terms such as 2.5PN effects, orbital hardening of the outer binary, and the effect of the dynamical friction on the early stages of the intruder dynamics. In this first paper of a series devoted at studing the dynamics of MBH triplets from a cosmological perspective, we describe, test and validate our code.},

	abstract = {Coalescing massive black hole binaries (MBHBs) of \$10{\textasciicircum}\{4-7\} {\textbackslash}rm M\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}\$, forming in the aftermath of galaxy mergers, are primary targets of the space mission LISA, the \{{\textbackslash}it Laser Interferometer Space Antenna\}. An assessment of LISA detection prospects requires an estimate of the abundance and properties of MBHBs that form and evolve during the assembly of cosmic structures. To this aim, we employ a semi-analytic model to follow the co-evolution of MBHBs within their host galaxies. We identify three major evolutionary channels driving the binaries to coalescence: two standard paths along which the binary evolution is driven by interactions with the stellar and/or gaseous environment, and a novel channel where MBHB coalescence occurs during the interaction with a third black hole. For each channel, we follow the orbital evolution of MBHBs with physically motivated models that include a self-consistent treatment of the orbital eccentricity. We find that LISA will detect between \${\textbackslash}approx 25\$ and \${\textbackslash}approx 75\$ events per year depending on the seed model. We show that triple-induced coalescences can range from a few detected events up to \${\textbackslash}sim 30{\textbackslash}\%\$ of the total detected mergers. Moreover, even if the standard gas/stars-driven evolutionary channels should fail and MBHBs were to stall, triple interactions would still occur as a result of the hierarchical nature of galaxy formation, resulting in about \${\textbackslash}approx 10\$ to \${\textbackslash}approx 20\$ LISA detections per year. Remarkably, triple interactions among the black holes can produce coalescing binaries with large eccentricities (\${\textbackslash}gtrsim 0.9\$) upon entrance into the LISA band. This eccentricity will remain significant (\${\textbackslash}sim 0.1\$) also at merger, requiring suitable templates for parameter estimation.},

	abstract = {Massive black hole (MBH) binary inspiral time scales are uncertain, and their spins are even more poorly constrained. Spin misalignment, along with unequal mass ratios and spin magnitudes, introduces asymmetry in the gravitational radiation, which imparts a recoil kick to the merged MBH. Understanding how MBH binary spins evolve is crucial for determining their recoil velocities, their gravitational wave (GW) waveforms detectable with LISA, as well as their post-merger retention rate in galaxies and thus their subsequent merger rate. Here we present a novel study that introduces a sub-resolution model for gas- and GW-driven MBH binary spin evolution using a population of accreting MBHs from the Illustris cosmological hydrodynamics simulations. We also model sub-resolution binary inspiral via dynamical friction, stellar scattering, viscous gas drag, and GW emission. Our model assumes differential accretion, which causes greater alignment of the secondary MBH spin in unequal-mass mergers. We find that 47\% of the MBHs in our population merge by \$z=0\$. Of these, 19\% have misaligned primaries and 10\% have misaligned secondaries at the time of merger in our (conservative) fiducial model. The MBH misalignment fraction depends strongly on the accretion disc parameters, however. Reducing accretion rates by a factor of 100, in a thicker disc, yields 79\% and 42\% misalignment for primaries and secondaries, respectively. Even in the fiducial model, more than 12\% of binaries experience recoils of \${\textgreater}500\$ km s\${\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$, which could displace them at least temporarily from galactic nuclei. We additionally find that a significant number of systems experience strong precession.},

	abstract = {Massive black hole (MBH) binaries can form following a galaxy merger, but this may not always lead to a MBH binary merger within a Hubble time. The merger timescale depends on how efficiently the MBHs lose orbital energy to the gas and stellar background, and to gravitational waves (GWs). In systems where these mechanisms are inefficient, the binary inspiral time can be long enough for a subsequent galaxy merger to bring a third MBH into the system. In this work, we identify and characterize the population of triple MBH systems in the Illustris cosmological hydrodynamic simulation. We find a substantial occurrence rate of triple MBH systems: in our fiducial model, 22\% of all binary systems form triples, and \${\textgreater}70\$\% of these involve binaries that would not otherwise merge by \$z=0\$. Furthermore, a significant subset of triples (6\% of all binaries, or more than a quarter of all triples) form a triple system at parsec scales, where the three BHs are most likely to undergo a strong three-body interaction. Crucially, we find that the rate of triple occurrence has only a weak dependence on key parameters of the binary inspiral model (binary eccentricity and stellar loss-cone refilling rate). We also do not observe strong trends in the host galaxy properties for binary versus triple MBH populations. Our results demonstrate the potential for triple systems to increase MBH merger rates, thereby enhancing the low-frequency GW signals detectable with pulsar timing arrays and with LISA.},

	abstract = {In the last stages of a black hole merger, the binary can experience a recoil due to asymmetric emission of gravitational radiation. Recent numerical relativity simulations suggest that the recoil velocity can be as high as a few thousands kilometers per second for particular configurations. We consider here the effect of a worst case scenario for orbital and phase configurations on the hierarchical evolution of the massive black hole (MBH) population. The orbital configuration and spin orientation in the plane is chosen to be the one yielding the highest possible kick. Masses and spin magnitudes are instead derived self-consistently from the MBH evolutionary models. If seeds form early, for example, as remnants of the first stars, almost the totality of the first few generation of binaries are ejected. The fraction of lost binaries decreases at later times due to a combination of the binary mass ratio distribution becoming shallower, and the deepening of the hosts' potential wells. If seeds form at later times, in more massive halos, then the retention rate is much higher. We show that the gravitational recoil does not pose a threat to the evolution of the MBH population that we observe locally in either case, although high-mass seeds seem to be favored. The gravitational recoil is instead a real hazard for (1) MBHs in biased halos at high redshift, where mergers are more common and the potential wells still relatively shallow. Similarly, it is very challenging to retain (2) MBHs merging in star clusters.},

	abstract = {We assess models for the assembly of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) at the center of galaxies that trace their hierarchical buildup far up in the dark halo ``merger tree.'' Motivated by the recent discovery of luminous quasars around redshift z{\textasciitilde}6-suggesting a very early assembly epoch-and by numerical simulations of the fragmentation of primordial molecular clouds in cold dark matter (CDM) cosmogonies, we assume that the first ``seed'' black holes (BHs) had intermediate masses and formed in (mini)halos collapsing at z{\textasciitilde}20 from high-σ density fluctuations. As these pregalactic holes become incorporated through a series of mergers into larger and larger halos, they sink to the center because of dynamical friction, accrete a fraction of the gas in the merger remnant to become supermassive, form a binary system, and eventually coalesce. The merger history of dark matter halos and associated BHs is followed by cosmological Monte Carlo realizations of the merger hierarchy from early times until the present in a ΛCDM cosmology. A simple model, where quasar activity is driven by major mergers and SMBHs accrete at the Eddington rate a mass that scales with the fifth power of the circular velocity of the host halo, is shown to reproduce the observed luminosity function of optically selected quasars in the redshift range 1-2 is promptly regenerated after every major merger event, replenishing the mass displaced by the binary. Triple BH interactions will inevitably take place at early times if the formation route for the assembly of SMBHs goes back to the very first generation of stars, and we follow them in our merger tree. The assumptions underlying our scenario lead to the prediction of a population of massive BHs wandering in galaxy halos and the intergalactic medium at the present epoch and contributing {\textless}{\textasciitilde}10\% to the total BH mass density, ρSMBH=4×105 Msolar Mpc-3 (h=0.7). The fraction of binary SMBHs in galaxy nuclei is on the order of 10\% today, and it increases with redshift so that almost all massive nuclear BHs at early epochs are in binary systems. The fraction of binary quasars (both members brighter than 0.1L*) instead is less than 0.3\% at all epochs. The nuclear SMBH occupation fraction is unity (0.6) at the present epoch if the first seed BHs were as numerous as the 3.5 σ (4 σ) density peaks at z=20.},

	abstract = {We report multiple lines of evidence for a stochastic signal that is correlated among 67 pulsars from the 15 yr pulsar timing data set collected by the North American Nanohertz Observatory for Gravitational Waves. The correlations follow the Hellings-Downs pattern expected for a stochastic gravitational-wave background. The presence of such a gravitational-wave background with a power-law spectrum is favored over a model with only independent pulsar noises with a Bayes factor in excess of 1014, and this same model is favored over an uncorrelated common power-law spectrum model with Bayes factors of 200-1000, depending on spectral modeling choices. We have built a statistical background distribution for the latter Bayes factors using a method that removes interpulsar correlations from our data set, finding p = 10-3 (≈3σ) for the observed Bayes factors in the null no-correlation scenario. A frequentist test statistic built directly as a weighted sum of interpulsar correlations yields p = 5 × 10-5 to 1.9 × 10-4 (≈3.5σ-4σ). Assuming a fiducial f -2/3 characteristic strain spectrum, as appropriate for an ensemble of binary supermassive black hole inspirals, the strain amplitude is \$\{2.4\}\_\{-0.6\}{\textasciicircum}\{+0.7\}{\textbackslash}times \{10\}{\textasciicircum}\{-15\}\$ (median + 90\% credible interval) at a reference frequency of 1 yr-1. The inferred gravitational-wave background amplitude and spectrum are consistent with astrophysical expectations for a signal from a population of supermassive black hole binaries, although more exotic cosmological and astrophysical sources cannot be excluded. The observation of Hellings-Downs correlations points to the gravitational-wave origin of this signal.},

	abstract = {We present the results of the search for an isotropic stochastic gravitational wave background (GWB) at nanohertz frequencies using the second data release of the European Pulsar Timing Array (EPTA) for 25 millisecond pulsars and a combination with the first data release of the Indian Pulsar Timing Array (InPTA). We analysed (i) the full 24.7-year EPTA data set, (ii) its 10.3-year subset based on modern observing systems, (iii) the combination of the full data set with the first data release of the InPTA for ten commonly timed millisecond pulsars, and (iv) the combination of the 10.3-year subset with the InPTA data. These combinations allowed us to probe the contributions of instrumental noise and interstellar propagation effects. With the full data set, we find marginal evidence for a GWB, with a Bayes factor of four and a false alarm probability of \$4{\textbackslash}\%\$. With the 10.3-year subset, we report evidence for a GWB, with a Bayes factor of \$60\$ and a false alarm probability of about \$0.1{\textbackslash}\%\$ (\${\textbackslash}gtrsim 3{\textbackslash}sigma\$ significance). The addition of the InPTA data yields results that are broadly consistent with the EPTA-only data sets, with the benefit of better noise modelling. Analyses were performed with different data processing pipelines to test the consistency of the results from independent software packages. The inferred spectrum from the latest EPTA data from new generation observing systems is rather uncertain and in mild tension with the common signal measured in the full data set. However, if the spectral index is fixed at 13/3, the two data sets give a similar amplitude of (\$2.5{\textbackslash}pm0.7){\textbackslash}times10{\textasciicircum}\{-15\}\$ at a reference frequency of \$1{\textbackslash},\{{\textbackslash}rm yr\}{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$. By continuing our detection efforts as part of the International Pulsar Timing Array (IPTA), we expect to be able to improve the measurement of spatial correlations and better characterise this signal in the coming years.},

	abstract = {Observing and timing a group of millisecond pulsars with high rotational stability enables the direct detection of gravitational waves (GWs). The GW signals can be identified from the spatial correlations encoded in the times-of-arrival of widely spaced pulsar-pairs. The Chinese Pulsar Timing Array (CPTA) is a collaboration aiming at the direct GW detection with observations carried out using Chinese radio telescopes. This short article serves as a “table of contents” for a forthcoming series of papers related to the CPTA Data Release 1 (CPTA DR1) which uses observations from the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope. Here, after summarizing the time span and accuracy of CPTA DR1, we report the key results of our statistical inference finding a correlated signal with amplitude for spectral index in the range of α ∈ [ − 1.8, 1.5] assuming a GW background (GWB) induced quadrupolar correlation. The search for the Hellings–Downs (HD) correlation curve is also presented, where some evidence for the HD correlation has been found that a 4.6σ statistical significance is achieved using the discrete frequency method around the frequency of 14 nHz. We expect that the future International Pulsar Timing Array data analysis and the next CPTA data release will be more sensitive to the nHz GWB, which could verify the current results.},

	abstract = {Supermassive black holes are investigated as possible sources for low-frequency bursts of gravity waves. The event rate for `known' supermassive black holes at intermediate and high redshifts, inferred from the quasar luminosity function, is low \${\textbackslash}sim 0.1 {\textbackslash}yr{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$. A space-based interferometer could therefore only see several events per year from supermassive black holes if an additional population of supermassive black holes existed and emitted gravitational waves efficiently. These might reside in the population of dwarf galaxies or in a transient population of small dark matter haloes that have mostly merged into larger haloes hosting the galaxies seen today. The proposed space-based gravitational-wave interferometer LISA/SAGITTARIUS should detect most gravitational-wave events involving supermassive black holes above \$10{\textasciicircum}\{4\} {\textbackslash}Msol\$ out to redshifts of \$z {\textbackslash}sim 100\$.},

	abstract = {Pulsar timing arrays aim to detect nanohertz-frequency gravitational waves (GWs). A background of GWs modulates pulsar arrival times and manifests as a stochastic process, common to all pulsars, with a signature spatial correlation. Here we describe a search for an isotropic stochastic gravitational-wave background (GWB) using observations of 30 millisecond pulsars from the third data release of the Parkes Pulsar Timing Array (PPTA), which spans 18 yr. Using current Bayesian inference techniques we recover and characterize a common-spectrum noise process. Represented as a strain spectrum \$\{h\}\_\{c\}=A\{(f/1\{{\textbackslash}mathrm\{yr\}\}{\textasciicircum}\{-1\})\}{\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}alpha \}\$ , we measure \$A=\{3.1\}\_\{-0.9\}{\textasciicircum}\{+1.3\}{\textbackslash}times \{10\}{\textasciicircum}\{-15\}\$ and α = -0.45 ± 0.20, respectively (median and 68\% credible interval). For a spectral index of α = -2/3, corresponding to an isotropic background of GWs radiated by inspiraling supermassive black hole binaries, we recover an amplitude of \$A=\{2.04\}\_\{-0.22\}{\textasciicircum}\{+0.25\}{\textbackslash}times \{10\}{\textasciicircum}\{-15\}\$ . However, we demonstrate that the apparent signal strength is time-dependent, as the first half of our data set can be used to place an upper limit on A that is in tension with the inferred common-spectrum amplitude using the complete data set. We search for spatial correlations in the observations by hierarchically analyzing individual pulsar pairs, which also allows for significance validation through randomizing pulsar positions on the sky. For a process with α = -2/3, we measure spatial correlations consistent with a GWB, with an estimated false-alarm probability of p ≲ 0.02 (approx. 2σ). The long timing baselines of the PPTA and the access to southern pulsars will continue to play an important role in the International Pulsar Timing Array.},

    abstract = "{The abundance and structure of dark matter subhaloes have been analysed extensively in recent studies of dark-matter-only simulations, but comparatively little is known about the impact of baryonic physics on halo substructures. We here extend the subfind algorithm for substructure identification such that it can be reliably applied to dissipative hydrodynamical simulations that include star formation. This allows, in particular, the identification of galaxies as substructures in simulations of clusters of galaxies and a determination of their content of gravitationally bound stars, dark matter and hot and cold gas. Using a large set of cosmological cluster simulations, we present a detailed analysis of halo substructures in hydrodynamical simulations of galaxy clusters, focusing in particular on the influence both of radiative and non-radiative gas physics and of non-standard physics such as thermal conduction and feedback by galactic outflows. We also examine the impact of numerical nuisance parameters such as artificial viscosity parameterizations. We find that diffuse hot gas is efficiently stripped from subhaloes when they enter the highly pressurized cluster atmosphere. This has the effect of decreasing the subhalo mass function relative to a corresponding dark-matter-only simulation. These effects are mitigated in radiative runs, where baryons condense in the central subhalo regions and form compact stellar cores. However, in all cases, only a very small fraction, of the order of one per cent, of subhaloes within the cluster virial radii preserve a gravitationally bound hot gaseous atmosphere. The fraction of mass contributed by gas in subhaloes is found to increase with the cluster-centric distance. Interestingly, this trend extends well beyond the virial radii, thus showing that galaxies feel the environment of the pressurized cluster gas over fairly large distances. The compact stellar cores (i.e. galaxies) are generally more resistant against tidal disruption than pure dark matter subhaloes. Still, the fraction of star-dominated substructures within our simulated clusters is only ∼10 per cent. We expect that the finite resolution in our simulations makes the galaxies overly susceptible to tidal disruption, hence the above fraction of star-dominated galaxies should represent a lower limit for the actual fraction of galaxies surviving the disruption of their host dark matter subhalo.}",

	abstract = {Recent numerical relativity simulations have shown that the emission of gravitational waves during the merger of two supermassive black holes (SMBHs) delivers a kick to the final hole, with a magnitude as large as 4000 km s-1. We study the motion of SMBHs ejected from galaxy cores by such kicks and the effects on the stellar distribution using high-accuracy direct N-body simulations. Following the kick, the motion of the SMBH exhibits three distinct phases. (1) The SMBH oscillates with decreasing amplitude, losing energy via dynamical friction at each core passage. Chandrasekhar's theory accurately reproduces the motion of the SMBH if 2lesssim ln Λ lesssim 3 and if the changing core density is taken into account. (2) When the amplitude of the motion has fallen to roughly the core radius, the SMBH and core begin to exhibit oscillations about their common center of mass. These oscillations decay with a time constant that is at least 10 times longer than predicted by Chandrasekhar's formula. (3) Eventually, the SMBH reaches thermal equilibrium with the stars. The time for the SMBH's oscillations to damp to the Brownian level is as long as {\textasciitilde}1 Gyr in the brightest galaxies. The longevity of the oscillations makes this mechanism competitive with others proposed to explain double or offset nuclei. Ejection of SMBHs also results in a lowered density of stars near the galaxy center; mass deficits as large as five times the SMBH mass can be produced. We compare the N-body density profiles with luminosity profiles of early-type galaxies in Virgo and show that even the largest observed cores can be reproduced by the kicks. Implications for displaced AGNs and helical radio structures are discussed.},

	abstract = {Gravitational-wave recoil of merging supermassive black holes (SMBHs) may inﬂuence the co-evolution of SMBHs and their host galaxies. We examine this possibility using smoothed particle hydrodynamic/N-body simulations of gaseous galaxy mergers, including SMBH accretion, in which the merged BH receives a recoil kick. This enables us to follow the trajectories and accretion of recoiling BHs in self-consistent, evolving merger remnants. In contrast to recent studies on similar topics, we conduct a large parameter study, generating a suite of over 200 simulations with more than 60 merger models and a range of recoil velocities (vk). With this, we can identify systematic trends in the behaviour of recoiling BHs. Our main results are as follows. (1) BHs kicked at nearly the central escape speed (vesc) may oscillate on large orbits for up to a Hubble time, but in gas-rich mergers, BHs kicked with up to ∼0.7vesc may be conﬁned to the central few kpc of the galaxy, owing to gas drag and steep central potentials. (2) vesc in gas-rich mergers may increase rapidly during ﬁnal coalescence, in which case recoil trajectories may depend sensitively on the timing of the BH merger relative to the formation of the central potential well. Delays of even a few times 107 yr in the BH merger time may substantially suppress recoiling BH motion for a ﬁxed kick speed. (3) Recoil events generally reduce the lifetimes of bright active galactic nuclei (AGNs), but short-period recoil oscillations may actually extend AGN lifetimes at lower luminosities. (4) Bondi–Hoyle accretion dominates recoiling BH growth for vk/vesc 0.6–0.8; for higher vk, the BH accretes primarily from its ejected gas disc, which we model as a time-dependent accretion disc. (5) Kinematically offset AGNs may be observable either immediately after a high-velocity recoil or during pericentric passages through a gas-rich remnant. In either case, AGN lifetimes may be up to ∼10 Myr (for v {\textgreater} 800 km s−1), though the latter generally have higher luminosities. (6) Spatially offset AGNs can occur for vk 0.5–0.7vesc (for R {\textgreater} 1 kpc); these generally have low luminosities and lifetimes of ∼1–100 Myr. (7) Rapidly recoiling BHs may be up to approximately ﬁve times less massive than their stationary counterparts. These mass deﬁcits lower the normalization of the MBH–σ ∗ relation and contribute to both intrinsic and overall scatter. (8) Finally, the displacement of AGN feedback after a recoil event enhances central star formation rates in the merger remnant, thereby extending the starburst phase of the merger and creating a denser, more massive stellar cusp.},

	abstract = {The density of stars in galactic bulges is often observed to be flat or slowly rising inside the influence radius of the supermassive black hole (SMBH). Attributing the dynamical-friction force to stars moving more slowly than the test body, as is commonly done, is likely to be a poor approximation in such a core since there are no stars moving more slowly than the local circular velocity. We have tested this prediction using large-scale N-body experiments. The rate of orbital decay never drops precisely to zero, because stars moving faster than the test body also contribute to the frictional force. When the contribution from the fast-moving stars is included in the expression for the dynamical-friction force, and the changes induced by the massive body on the stellar distribution are taken into account, Chandrasekhar's theory is found to reproduce the rate of orbital decay remarkably well. However, this rate is still substantially smaller than the rate predicted by Chandrasekhar's formula in its most widely used forms, implying longer timescale for inspiral. Motivated by recent observations that suggest a parsec-scale core around the Galactic center (GC) SMBH, we investigate the evolution of a population of stellar-mass black holes (BHs) as they spiral into the center of the Galaxy. After {\textasciitilde}10 Gyr, we find that the density of BHs can remain substantially less than the density in stars at all radii; we conclude that it would be unjustified to assume that the spatial distribution of BHs at the GC is well described by steady-state models. One consequence is that rates of capture of BHs by the SMBH at the Galactic center (extreme-mass-ratio inspirals) may be much lower than in standard models. When capture occurs, inspiraling BHs often reach the gravitational-radiation-dominated regime while on orbits that are still highly eccentric; even after the semimajor axis has decreased to values small enough for detection by space-based interferometers, eccentricities can be large enough that the efficient analysis of gravitational wave signals would require the use of eccentric templates. We finally study the orbital decay of satellite galaxies into the central region of giant ellipticals and discuss the formation of multi nuclei and multiplet of black holes in such systems.},

	abstract = {We use a hybrid N-body program to study the evolution of massive black hole binaries in the centers of galaxies, mainly to understand the factors affecting the binary eccentricity, the response of the galaxy to the binary merger, and the effect of loss-cone depletion on the merger time. The scattering experiments from paper I (Quinlan, 1996)[NewA, 1, 35] showed that the merger time is not sensitive to the eccentricity growth unless a binary forms with at least a moderate eccentricity. We find here that the eccentricity can become large under some conditions if a binary forms in a galaxy with a flat core or with a radial bias in its velocity distribution, especially if the dynamical friction is enhanced by resonances as suggested by Rauch \& Tremaine (1996)[NewA, 1, 149]. But the necessary conditions seem unlikely, and our prediction from paper I remains unchanged: in most cases the eccentricity will start and remain small. The ejection of stars caused by the hardening of a binary may explain why large elliptical galaxies have weaker density cusps than smaller galaxies. If so, the central velocity distributions in those galaxies should have strong tangential anisotropies. The wandering of a binary from the center of a galaxy counteracts the effects of loss-cone depletion and helps the binary merge.},

	abstract = {We propose a simple dynamical mechanism to eject massive objects from the nuclei of galaxies. When three or more massive objects near the center interact strongly, the configuration becomes gravitationally unstable and splits up. In the case of three objects, two of them will usually form a compact binary and fling out the third. The recoil momentum can eject the binary from the galaxy in the opposite direction. To study the interaction for a large range of initial conditions, we have numerically computed the orbits of 25,000 triple systems and of 250 two-binary systems. Their general properties are analyzed and compared with the observed structures of extragalactic radio sources. The double nature of many radio sources, their association with the plane of a central elliptical galaxy, the presence of very compact radio components, and a number of other observed properties are readily related to the gravitational slingshot. We also discuss observational constraints on radio emission from the massive objects, and further observations of special interest.

The investigation was conducted by running more than 14,000 computer-simulated encounters between binaries and field stars for various preencounter relative velocities (Vf) and impact parameters. It is shown that at low values of Vf, an encounter causes a binary orbit to shrink and become more tightly bound. In this case, the two more massive of the three stars involved in the encounter will remain in the binary system while the third will be ejected from it at a relatively high velocity. It is found that the shrinking of more tightly bound binary orbits will destroy an open cluster in a few hundred million years unless the cluster is unusually massive or unusually deficient in binary stars. It is also found that binary stars are likely to limit the maximum density attainable in the nucleus of a globular cluster.},

The tidal force of the outer black hole on the inner binary produces eccentricity oscillations through the Kozai mechanism, and this can substantially reduce the gravitational wave merger time of the inner binary. We numerically calculate the merger time for a wide range of initial conditions and black hole mass ratios, including the effects of octupole interactions in the triple as well as general relativistic periastron precession in the inner binary. The semimajor axes and the mutual inclination of the inner and outer binaries are the most important factors affecting the merger time. We find that for a random distribution of inclination angles and approximately equal mass black holes, it is possible to reduce the merger time of a near circular inner binary by more than a factor of 10 in over 50\% of all cases. We estimate that a typical exterior quadrupole moment from surrounding matter in the galaxy may also be sufficient to excite eccentricity oscillations in supermassive black hole binaries and to accelerate black hole mergers.},

We found that in most cases two of the three BHs merge through gravitational wave (GW) radiation in a timescale much shorter than the Hubble time before ejecting one BH through a slingshot. In order for a binary BH to merge before ejecting the third one, it has to become highly eccentric, since the GW timescale would be much longer than the Hubble time unless the eccentricity is very high. We found that two mechanisms drive the increase of the eccentricity of the binary. One is the strong binary-single BH interaction, which results in the thermalization of the eccentricity. The second is the Kozai mechanism, which drives the cyclic change of the inclination and eccentricity of the inner binary of a stable hierarchical triple system. Our result implies that many supermassive BHs are binaries.},

In nine systems, the X-ray active galactic nucleus (AGN) is spatially offset from the galactic stellar core that is located within the 3″ diameter SDSS spectroscopic fiber. In 11 systems, the X-ray AGN is spatially offset from a stellar core that is located outside the fiber, with an overlap of two. To build the sample, we cross-matched Type II AGNs selected from the SDSS galaxy catalog with archival Chandra imaging and employed our custom astrometric and registration procedure. The projected angular (physical) offsets span a range of 0.″6 (0.8 kpc) to 17.″4 (19.4 kpc), with a median value of 2.″7 (4.6 kpc). The offset nature of an AGN is an unambiguous signature of a galaxy merger, and these systems can be used to study the properties of AGNs in galaxy mergers without the biases introduced by morphological merger selection techniques. In this paper (Paper I), we use our sample to assess the kinematics of AGN photoionized gas in galaxy mergers. We find that spectroscopic offset AGN selection may be up to \% incomplete due to small projected velocity offsets. We also find that the magnitude of the velocity offsets are generally larger than expected if our spatial selection introduces a bias toward face-on orbits, suggesting the presence of complex kinematics in the emission line gas of AGNs in galaxy mergers.},

Unlike most other currently available cosmological simulations, black holes are seeded based on local gas properties and are permitted to evolve dynamically without being fixed at halo centres. Tracking these black holes allows us to make robust predictions about the offset population. We find that the number of wandering black holes scales roughly linearly with the halo mass, such that we expect thousands of wandering black holes in galaxy cluster halos. Locally, these wanderers account for around 10 per cent of the local black hole mass budget once seed masses are accounted for. Yet for higher redshifts (\$z{\textbackslash}gtrsim 4\$), wandering black holes both outweigh and outshine their central supermassive counterparts. Most wandering black holes, we find, remain close to the seed mass and originate from the centres of previously disrupted satellite galaxies. While most do not retain a resolved stellar counterpart, those that do are situated farther out at larger fractions of the virial radius. Wanderers with higher luminosities are preferentially at lower radius, more massive, and either closer to their host's mid-planes or associated with a stellar overdensity. This analysis shows that our current census of supermassive black holes is incomplete and that a substantial population of off-centre wanderers likely exists.},

	abstract = {Simulations of binary black hole mergers indicate that asymmetrical gravitational wave (GW) emission can cause black holes to recoil at speeds up to thousands of km/s. These GW recoil events can dramatically affect the coevolution of recoiling supermassive black holes (SMBHs) and their host galaxies. However, theoretical studies of SMBH-galaxy evolution almost always assume a stationary central black hole. In light of the numerical results on GW recoil velocities, we relax that assumption here and consider the consequences of recoil for SMBH evolution. We follow the trajectories of SMBHs ejected in a smooth background potential that includes both a stellar bulge and a multi-component gaseous disk. In addition, we calculate the accretion rate onto the SMBH as a function of time using a hybrid prescription of viscous (alpha-disk) and Bondi accretion. We find that recoil kicks between 100 km/s and the escape speed cause SMBHs to wander through the galaxy and halo for about 1 Myr - 1 Gyr before settling back to the galactic center. However, the mass accreted during this time is roughly constant at about 10\% of the initial mass, independent of the recoil velocity. This indicates that while large recoils may disrupt active galactic nuclei feedback processes, recoil itself is an effective means of regulating SMBH growth. Recoiling SMBHs may be observable as spatially or kinematically offset quasars, but finding such systems could be challenging, because the largest offsets correspond to the shortest quasar lifetimes.},

	abstract = {We study the efficiency and dynamics of supermassive black hole binary mergers driven by angular momentum loss to small-scale gas discs. Such binaries form after major galaxy mergers, but their fate is unclear since hardening through stellar scattering becomes very inefficient at subparsec distances. Gas discs may dominate binary dynamics on these scales, and promote mergers. Using numerical simulations, we investigate the evolution of the semimajor axis and eccentricity of binaries embedded within geometrically thin gas discs. Our simulations directly resolve angular momentum transport within the disc, which at the radii of interest is likely dominated by disc self-gravity. We show that the binary decays at a rate which is in good agreement with analytical estimates, while the eccentricity grows. Saturation of eccentricity growth is not observed up to values e≳ 0.35. Accretion on to the black holes is variable, and is roughly modulated by the binary orbital frequency. Scaling our results, we analytically estimate the maximum rate of binary decay that is possible without fragmentation occurring within the surrounding gas disc, and compare that rate to an estimate of the stellar dynamical hardening rate. For binary masses in the range 105≲M≲ 108 M⊙ we find that decay due to gas discs may dominate for separations below a∼ 0.01–0.1 pc, in the regime where the disc is optically thick. The minimum merger time-scale is shorter than the Hubble time for M≲ 107 M⊙. This implies that gas discs could commonly attend relatively low-mass black hole mergers, and that a significant population of binaries might exist at separations of a few hundredths of a parsec, where the combined decay rate is slowest. For more massive binaries, where this mechanism fails to act quickly enough, we suggest that scattering of stars formed within a fragmenting gas disc could act as a significant additional sink of binary angular momentum.},

Tearing discs with random orientations produce direct dynamical accretion on to the hole in ≈70 per cent of all cases. Here, we examine the evolution of a misaligned disc around a binary system. We show that these discs are susceptible to tearing for almost all inclinations. We also show that tearing of the disc can result in a significant acceleration of the disc evolution and subsequent accretion on to the binary – by factors up to 104 times that of a coplanar prograde disc with otherwise identical parameters. This provides a promising mechanism for driving mergers of supermassive black hole (SMBH) binaries on time-scales much shorter than a Hubble time. Disc tearing also suggests new observational signatures of accreting SMBH binaries and other systems such as protostellar binaries.},

	abstract = {The formation of massive black hole binaries (MBHBs) is an unavoidable outcome of galaxy evolution via successive mergers. However, the mechanism that drives their orbital evolution from parsec separations down to the gravitational wave dominated regime is poorly understood, and their final fate is still unclear. If such binaries are embedded in gas-rich and turbulent environments, as observed in remnants of galaxy mergers, the interaction with gas clumps (such as molecular clouds) may efficiently drive their orbital evolution. Using numerical simulations, we test this hypothesis by studying the dynamical evolution of an equal mass, circular MBHB accreting infalling molecular clouds. We investigate different orbital configurations, modelling a total of 13 systems to explore different possible impact parameters and relative inclinations of the cloud–binary encounter. We focus our study on the prompt, transient phase during the first few orbits when the dynamical evolution of the binary is fastest, finding that this evolution is dominated by the exchange of angular momentum through gas capture by the individual black holes and accretion. Building on these results, we construct a simple model for evolving an MBHB interacting with a sequence of clouds, which are randomly drawn from reasonable populations with different levels of anisotropy in their angular momenta distributions. We show that the binary efficiently evolves down to the gravitational wave emission regime within a few hundred million years, overcoming the ‘final parsec’ problem regardless of the stellar distribution.},

	abstract = {We compute the effect of an orbiting gas disc in promoting the coalescence of a central supermassive black hole binary. Unlike earlier studies, we consider a finite mass of gas with explicit time dependence: we do not assume that the gas necessarily adopts a steady state or a spatially constant accretion rate, i.e. that the merging black hole was somehow inserted into a pre-existing accretion disc. We consider the tidal torque of the binary on the disc, and the binary's gravitational radiation. We study the effects of star formation in the gas disc in a simple energy feedback framework.The disc spectrum differs in detail from that found before. In particular, tidal torques from the secondary black hole heat the edges of the gap, creating bright rims around the secondary. These rims do not in practice have uniform brightness either in azimuth or time, but can on average account for as much as 50 per cent of the integrated light from the disc. This may lead to detectable high-photon-energy variability on the relatively long orbital time-scale of the secondary black hole, and thus offer a prospective signature of a coalescing black hole binary.We also find that the disc can drive the binary to merger on a reasonable time-scale only if its mass is at least comparable with that of the secondary black hole, and if the initial binary separation is relatively small, i.e. a0≲ 0.05 pc. Star formation complicates the merger further by removing mass from the disc. In the feedback model we consider, this sets an effective limit to the disc mass. As a result, binary merging is unlikely unless the black hole mass ratio is ≲0.001. Gas discs thus appear not to be an effective solution to the ‘last parsec’ problem for a significant class of mergers.},

	abstract = {Gaseous disks have been proposed as a mechanism for facilitating mergers of binary black holes. We explore circumbinary disk systems to determine the evolution of the central binary. To do so, we perform 3D, hydrodynamic, locally isothermal simulations of circumbinary disks on a Cartesian grid. We focus on binaries of equal mass ratios on fixed circular orbits. To investigate the orbital evolution of the binary, we examine the various torques exerted on the system. For the case where the disk plane and binary orbital plane are aligned, we find that the total torque is positive so that the semimajor axis of the binary increases. For the misaligned case, we run simulations with the binary orbital plane and disk midplane misaligned by 45° and find the same results—the binary grows. The timescale for the circumbinary disk to realign to the plane of the binary is consistent with the global viscous timescale of the disk.},

	abstract = {We carry out 2D viscous hydrodynamics simulations of circumbinary disk (CBD) accretion using AREPO. We resolve the accretion flow from a large-scale CBD down to the streamers and disks around individual binary components. Extending our recent studies, we consider circular binaries with various mass ratios (0.1 ≤ qb ≤ 1) and study accretion from “infinite,” steady-supply disks and from finite-sized, viscously spreading tori. For “infinite” disks, a global steady state can be reached, and the accretion variability has a dominant frequency ∼0.2Ωb for qb {\textgreater} 0.5 and Ωb for qb {\textless} 0.5 (Ωb is the binary angular frequency). We find that the accretion “eigenvalue” l0—the net angular momentum transfer from the disk to the binary per unit accreted mass—is always positive and falls in the range (0.65– (with ab the binary separation), depending weakly on the mass ratio and viscosity. This leads to binary expansion when qb ≳ 0.3. Accretion from a finite torus can be separated into two phases: an initial transient phase, corresponding to the filling of the binary cavity, followed by a viscous pseudostationary phase, during which the torus viscously spreads and accretes onto the binary. In the viscous phase, the net torque on the binary per unit accreted mass is close to l0, the value derived for “infinite” disks. We conclude that binaries of similar mass accreting from CBDs gain angular momentum and expand over long timescales. This result significantly impacts the coalescence of supermassive binary black holes and newly formed binary stars. We offer a word of caution against conclusions drawn from simulations of transient accretion onto empty circumbinary cavities.},

	abstract = {The dynamics of two massive black holes in a rotationally supported nuclear disc of mass Mdisc= 108 M⊙ is explored using N-body/smoothed particle hydrodynamics simulations. Gas and star particles are copresent in the disc. Described by a Mestel profile, the disc has a vertical support provided by turbulence of the gas, and by stellar velocity dispersion. A primary black hole of mass 4 × 106 M⊙ is placed at the centre of the disc, while a secondary black hole is set initially on an eccentric corotating orbit in the disc plane. Its mass is in a 1:1, 1:4, and 1:10 ratio, relative to the primary. With this choice, we mimic the dynamics of black hole pairs released in the nuclear region at the end of a gas-rich galaxy merger. It is found that, under the action of dynamical friction, the two black holes form a close binary in ∼10 Myr. The inspiral process is insensitive to the mass fraction in stars and gas present in the disc and is accompanied by the circularization of the orbit. We detail the gaseous mass profile bound to each black hole that can lead to the formation of two small Keplerian discs, weighing ≈2 per cent of the black hole mass, and of size ∼0.01 pc. The mass of the tightly (loosely) bound particles increases (decreases) with time as the black holes spiral into closer and closer orbits. Double active galactic nucleus activity is expected to occur on an estimated time-scale of ≲10 Myr, comparable to the inspiral time-scale. The double nuclear point-like sources that may appear during dynamical evolution will have typical separations of ≲10 pc.},

	abstract = {Using few-body simulations, we investigate the evolution of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) in galaxies (\$M\_\{{\textbackslash}star\}=10{\textasciicircum}\{10\}-10{\textasciicircum}\{12\}\{{\textbackslash}rm M\}\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}\$ at \$z=0\$) at \$0{\textless}z{\textless}4\$. Following galaxy merger trees from the Millennium simulation, we model BH mergers with two extreme binary decay scenarios for the `hard binary' stage: a full or an empty loss cone. These two models should bracket the true evolution, and allow us to separately explore the role of dynamical friction and that of multi-body BH interactions on BH mergers. Using the computed merger rates, we infer the stochastic gravitational wave background (GWB). Our dynamical approach is a first attempt to study the dynamical evolution of multiple SMBHs in the host galaxies undergoing mergers with various mass ratios (\$10{\textasciicircum}\{-4\} {\textless} q\_\{{\textbackslash}star\} {\textless} 1\$). Our main result demonstrates that SMBH binaries are able to merge in both scenarios. In the empty loss cone case, we find that BHs merge via multi-body interactions, avoiding the `final parsec' problem, and entering the PTA band with substantial orbital eccentricity. Our full loss cone treatment, albeit more approximate, suggests that the eccentricity becomes even higher when GWs become dominant, leading to rapid coalescences (binary lifetime \${\textbackslash}lesssim1 \{{\textbackslash}rm {\textasciitilde}Gyr\}\$). Despite the lower merger rates in the empty loss cone case, due to their higher mass ratios and lower redshifts, the GWB in the full/empty loss cone models are comparable (\$0.70{\textbackslash}times10{\textasciicircum}\{-15\}\$ and \$0.53{\textbackslash}times10{\textasciicircum}\{-15\}\$ at a frequency of \$1{\textasciitilde}\{{\textbackslash}rm yr\}{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$, respectively). Finally, we compute the effects of high eccentricities on the GWB spectrum.},
