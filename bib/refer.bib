	abstract = {Massive black hole binaries (MBHBs) are expected to form at the centre of merging galaxies during the hierarchical assembly of the cosmic structure, and are expected to be the loudest sources of gravitational waves (GWs) in the low frequency domain. However, because of the dearth of energy exchanges with background stars and gas, many of these MBHBs may stall at separations too large for GW emission to drive them to coalescence in less than a Hubble time. Triple MBH systems are then bound to form after a further galaxy merger, triggering a complex and rich dynamics that can eventually lead to MBH coalescence. Here we report on the results of a large set of numerical simulations, where MBH triplets are set in spherical stellar potentials and MBH dynamics is followed through 2.5 post-Newtonian order in the equations of motion. From our full suite of simulated systems we find that a fraction \${\textbackslash}simeq 20-30\$\% of the MBH binaries that would otherwise stall are led to coalesce within a Hubble time. The corresponding coalescence timescale peaks around 300 Myr, while the eccentricity close to the plunge, albeit small, is non-negligible (\${\textbackslash}lesssim 0.1\$). We construct and discuss marginalised probability distributions of the main parameters involved and, in a companion paper of the series, we will use the results presented here to forecast the contribution of MBH triplets to the GW signal in the nHz regime probed by Pulsar Timing Array experiments.},

	abstract = {Massive black-hole binaries (MBHBs) are thought to be the main source of gravitational waves (GWs) in the low-frequency domain surveyed by ongoing and forthcoming Pulsar Timing Array campaigns and future space-borne missions, such as \{{\textbackslash}it eLISA\}. However, many low-redshift MBHBs in realistic astrophysical environments may not reach separations small enough to allow significant GW emission, but rather stall on (sub)pc-scale orbits. This "last-parsec problem" can be eased by the appearance of a third massive black hole (MBH) -- the "intruder" -- whose action can force, under certain conditions, the inner MBHB on a very eccentric orbit, hence allowing intense GW emission eventually leading to coalescence. A detailed assessment of the process, ultimately driven by the induced Kozai-Lidov oscillations of the MBHB orbit, requires a general relativistic treatment and the inclusion of external factors, such as the Newtonian precession of the intruder orbit in the galactic potential and its hardening by scattering off background stars. In order to tackle this problem, we developed a three-body Post-Newtonian (PN) code framed in a realistic galactic potential, including both non-dissipative 1PN and 2PN terms, and dissipative terms such as 2.5PN effects, orbital hardening of the outer binary, and the effect of the dynamical friction on the early stages of the intruder dynamics. In this first paper of a series devoted at studing the dynamics of MBH triplets from a cosmological perspective, we describe, test and validate our code.},

	abstract = {Coalescing massive black hole binaries (MBHBs) of \$10{\textasciicircum}\{4-7\} {\textbackslash}rm M\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}\$, forming in the aftermath of galaxy mergers, are primary targets of the space mission LISA, the \{{\textbackslash}it Laser Interferometer Space Antenna\}. An assessment of LISA detection prospects requires an estimate of the abundance and properties of MBHBs that form and evolve during the assembly of cosmic structures. To this aim, we employ a semi-analytic model to follow the co-evolution of MBHBs within their host galaxies. We identify three major evolutionary channels driving the binaries to coalescence: two standard paths along which the binary evolution is driven by interactions with the stellar and/or gaseous environment, and a novel channel where MBHB coalescence occurs during the interaction with a third black hole. For each channel, we follow the orbital evolution of MBHBs with physically motivated models that include a self-consistent treatment of the orbital eccentricity. We find that LISA will detect between \${\textbackslash}approx 25\$ and \${\textbackslash}approx 75\$ events per year depending on the seed model. We show that triple-induced coalescences can range from a few detected events up to \${\textbackslash}sim 30{\textbackslash}\%\$ of the total detected mergers. Moreover, even if the standard gas/stars-driven evolutionary channels should fail and MBHBs were to stall, triple interactions would still occur as a result of the hierarchical nature of galaxy formation, resulting in about \${\textbackslash}approx 10\$ to \${\textbackslash}approx 20\$ LISA detections per year. Remarkably, triple interactions among the black holes can produce coalescing binaries with large eccentricities (\${\textbackslash}gtrsim 0.9\$) upon entrance into the LISA band. This eccentricity will remain significant (\${\textbackslash}sim 0.1\$) also at merger, requiring suitable templates for parameter estimation.},

	abstract = {Massive black hole (MBH) binary inspiral time scales are uncertain, and their spins are even more poorly constrained. Spin misalignment, along with unequal mass ratios and spin magnitudes, introduces asymmetry in the gravitational radiation, which imparts a recoil kick to the merged MBH. Understanding how MBH binary spins evolve is crucial for determining their recoil velocities, their gravitational wave (GW) waveforms detectable with LISA, as well as their post-merger retention rate in galaxies and thus their subsequent merger rate. Here we present a novel study that introduces a sub-resolution model for gas- and GW-driven MBH binary spin evolution using a population of accreting MBHs from the Illustris cosmological hydrodynamics simulations. We also model sub-resolution binary inspiral via dynamical friction, stellar scattering, viscous gas drag, and GW emission. Our model assumes differential accretion, which causes greater alignment of the secondary MBH spin in unequal-mass mergers. We find that 47\% of the MBHs in our population merge by \$z=0\$. Of these, 19\% have misaligned primaries and 10\% have misaligned secondaries at the time of merger in our (conservative) fiducial model. The MBH misalignment fraction depends strongly on the accretion disc parameters, however. Reducing accretion rates by a factor of 100, in a thicker disc, yields 79\% and 42\% misalignment for primaries and secondaries, respectively. Even in the fiducial model, more than 12\% of binaries experience recoils of \${\textgreater}500\$ km s\${\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$, which could displace them at least temporarily from galactic nuclei. We additionally find that a significant number of systems experience strong precession.},

	abstract = {Massive black hole (MBH) binaries can form following a galaxy merger, but this may not always lead to a MBH binary merger within a Hubble time. The merger timescale depends on how efficiently the MBHs lose orbital energy to the gas and stellar background, and to gravitational waves (GWs). In systems where these mechanisms are inefficient, the binary inspiral time can be long enough for a subsequent galaxy merger to bring a third MBH into the system. In this work, we identify and characterize the population of triple MBH systems in the Illustris cosmological hydrodynamic simulation. We find a substantial occurrence rate of triple MBH systems: in our fiducial model, 22\% of all binary systems form triples, and \${\textgreater}70\$\% of these involve binaries that would not otherwise merge by \$z=0\$. Furthermore, a significant subset of triples (6\% of all binaries, or more than a quarter of all triples) form a triple system at parsec scales, where the three BHs are most likely to undergo a strong three-body interaction. Crucially, we find that the rate of triple occurrence has only a weak dependence on key parameters of the binary inspiral model (binary eccentricity and stellar loss-cone refilling rate). We also do not observe strong trends in the host galaxy properties for binary versus triple MBH populations. Our results demonstrate the potential for triple systems to increase MBH merger rates, thereby enhancing the low-frequency GW signals detectable with pulsar timing arrays and with LISA.},

	abstract = {In the last stages of a black hole merger, the binary can experience a recoil due to asymmetric emission of gravitational radiation. Recent numerical relativity simulations suggest that the recoil velocity can be as high as a few thousands kilometers per second for particular configurations. We consider here the effect of a worst case scenario for orbital and phase configurations on the hierarchical evolution of the massive black hole (MBH) population. The orbital configuration and spin orientation in the plane is chosen to be the one yielding the highest possible kick. Masses and spin magnitudes are instead derived self-consistently from the MBH evolutionary models. If seeds form early, for example, as remnants of the first stars, almost the totality of the first few generation of binaries are ejected. The fraction of lost binaries decreases at later times due to a combination of the binary mass ratio distribution becoming shallower, and the deepening of the hosts' potential wells. If seeds form at later times, in more massive halos, then the retention rate is much higher. We show that the gravitational recoil does not pose a threat to the evolution of the MBH population that we observe locally in either case, although high-mass seeds seem to be favored. The gravitational recoil is instead a real hazard for (1) MBHs in biased halos at high redshift, where mergers are more common and the potential wells still relatively shallow. Similarly, it is very challenging to retain (2) MBHs merging in star clusters.},

	abstract = {We assess models for the assembly of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) at the center of galaxies that trace their hierarchical buildup far up in the dark halo ``merger tree.'' Motivated by the recent discovery of luminous quasars around redshift z{\textasciitilde}6-suggesting a very early assembly epoch-and by numerical simulations of the fragmentation of primordial molecular clouds in cold dark matter (CDM) cosmogonies, we assume that the first ``seed'' black holes (BHs) had intermediate masses and formed in (mini)halos collapsing at z{\textasciitilde}20 from high-σ density fluctuations. As these pregalactic holes become incorporated through a series of mergers into larger and larger halos, they sink to the center because of dynamical friction, accrete a fraction of the gas in the merger remnant to become supermassive, form a binary system, and eventually coalesce. The merger history of dark matter halos and associated BHs is followed by cosmological Monte Carlo realizations of the merger hierarchy from early times until the present in a ΛCDM cosmology. A simple model, where quasar activity is driven by major mergers and SMBHs accrete at the Eddington rate a mass that scales with the fifth power of the circular velocity of the host halo, is shown to reproduce the observed luminosity function of optically selected quasars in the redshift range 1-2 is promptly regenerated after every major merger event, replenishing the mass displaced by the binary. Triple BH interactions will inevitably take place at early times if the formation route for the assembly of SMBHs goes back to the very first generation of stars, and we follow them in our merger tree. The assumptions underlying our scenario lead to the prediction of a population of massive BHs wandering in galaxy halos and the intergalactic medium at the present epoch and contributing {\textless}{\textasciitilde}10\% to the total BH mass density, ρSMBH=4×105 Msolar Mpc-3 (h=0.7). The fraction of binary SMBHs in galaxy nuclei is on the order of 10\% today, and it increases with redshift so that almost all massive nuclear BHs at early epochs are in binary systems. The fraction of binary quasars (both members brighter than 0.1L*) instead is less than 0.3\% at all epochs. The nuclear SMBH occupation fraction is unity (0.6) at the present epoch if the first seed BHs were as numerous as the 3.5 σ (4 σ) density peaks at z=20.},

	abstract = {We report multiple lines of evidence for a stochastic signal that is correlated among 67 pulsars from the 15 yr pulsar timing data set collected by the North American Nanohertz Observatory for Gravitational Waves. The correlations follow the Hellings-Downs pattern expected for a stochastic gravitational-wave background. The presence of such a gravitational-wave background with a power-law spectrum is favored over a model with only independent pulsar noises with a Bayes factor in excess of 1014, and this same model is favored over an uncorrelated common power-law spectrum model with Bayes factors of 200-1000, depending on spectral modeling choices. We have built a statistical background distribution for the latter Bayes factors using a method that removes interpulsar correlations from our data set, finding p = 10-3 (≈3σ) for the observed Bayes factors in the null no-correlation scenario. A frequentist test statistic built directly as a weighted sum of interpulsar correlations yields p = 5 × 10-5 to 1.9 × 10-4 (≈3.5σ-4σ). Assuming a fiducial f -2/3 characteristic strain spectrum, as appropriate for an ensemble of binary supermassive black hole inspirals, the strain amplitude is \$\{2.4\}\_\{-0.6\}{\textasciicircum}\{+0.7\}{\textbackslash}times \{10\}{\textasciicircum}\{-15\}\$ (median + 90\% credible interval) at a reference frequency of 1 yr-1. The inferred gravitational-wave background amplitude and spectrum are consistent with astrophysical expectations for a signal from a population of supermassive black hole binaries, although more exotic cosmological and astrophysical sources cannot be excluded. The observation of Hellings-Downs correlations points to the gravitational-wave origin of this signal.},

We analysed (i) the full 24.7-year EPTA data set, (ii) its 10.3-year subset based on modern observing systems, (iii) the combination of the full data set with the first data release of the InPTA for ten commonly timed millisecond pulsars, and (iv) the combination of the 10.3-year subset with the InPTA data. These combinations allowed us to probe the contributions of instrumental noise and interstellar propagation effects. With the full data set, we find marginal evidence for a GWB, with a Bayes factor of four and a false alarm probability of \$4{\textbackslash}\%\$. With the 10.3-year subset, we report evidence for a GWB, with a Bayes factor of \$60\$ and a false alarm probability of about \$0.1{\textbackslash}\%\$ (\${\textbackslash}gtrsim 3{\textbackslash}sigma\$ significance). The addition of the InPTA data yields results that are broadly consistent with the EPTA-only data sets, with the benefit of better noise modelling. Analyses were performed with different data processing pipelines to test the consistency of the results from independent software packages. The inferred spectrum from the latest EPTA data from new generation observing systems is rather uncertain and in mild tension with the common signal measured in the full data set. However, if the spectral index is fixed at 13/3, the two data sets give a similar amplitude of (\$2.5{\textbackslash}pm0.7){\textbackslash}times10{\textasciicircum}\{-15\}\$ at a reference frequency of \$1{\textbackslash},\{{\textbackslash}rm yr\}{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$. By continuing our detection efforts as part of the International Pulsar Timing Array (IPTA), we expect to be able to improve the measurement of spatial correlations and better characterise this signal in the coming years.},

	abstract = {Observing and timing a group of millisecond pulsars with high rotational stability enables the direct detection of gravitational waves (GWs). The GW signals can be identified from the spatial correlations encoded in the times-of-arrival of widely spaced pulsar-pairs. The Chinese Pulsar Timing Array (CPTA) is a collaboration aiming at the direct GW detection with observations carried out using Chinese radio telescopes. This short article serves as a “table of contents” for a forthcoming series of papers related to the CPTA Data Release 1 (CPTA DR1) which uses observations from the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope. Here, after summarizing the time span and accuracy of CPTA DR1, we report the key results of our statistical inference finding a correlated signal with amplitude for spectral index in the range of α ∈ [ − 1.8, 1.5] assuming a GW background (GWB) induced quadrupolar correlation. The search for the Hellings–Downs (HD) correlation curve is also presented, where some evidence for the HD correlation has been found that a 4.6σ statistical significance is achieved using the discrete frequency method around the frequency of 14 nHz. We expect that the future International Pulsar Timing Array data analysis and the next CPTA data release will be more sensitive to the nHz GWB, which could verify the current results.},

	abstract = {Supermassive black holes are investigated as possible sources for low-frequency bursts of gravity waves. The event rate for `known' supermassive black holes at intermediate and high redshifts, inferred from the quasar luminosity function, is low \${\textbackslash}sim 0.1 {\textbackslash}yr{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$. A space-based interferometer could therefore only see several events per year from supermassive black holes if an additional population of supermassive black holes existed and emitted gravitational waves efficiently. These might reside in the population of dwarf galaxies or in a transient population of small dark matter haloes that have mostly merged into larger haloes hosting the galaxies seen today. The proposed space-based gravitational-wave interferometer LISA/SAGITTARIUS should detect most gravitational-wave events involving supermassive black holes above \$10{\textasciicircum}\{4\} {\textbackslash}Msol\$ out to redshifts of \$z {\textbackslash}sim 100\$.},

	abstract = {Pulsar timing arrays aim to detect nanohertz-frequency gravitational waves (GWs). A background of GWs modulates pulsar arrival times and manifests as a stochastic process, common to all pulsars, with a signature spatial correlation. Here we describe a search for an isotropic stochastic gravitational-wave background (GWB) using observations of 30 millisecond pulsars from the third data release of the Parkes Pulsar Timing Array (PPTA), which spans 18 yr. Using current Bayesian inference techniques we recover and characterize a common-spectrum noise process. Represented as a strain spectrum \$\{h\}\_\{c\}=A\{(f/1\{{\textbackslash}mathrm\{yr\}\}{\textasciicircum}\{-1\})\}{\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}alpha \}\$ , we measure \$A=\{3.1\}\_\{-0.9\}{\textasciicircum}\{+1.3\}{\textbackslash}times \{10\}{\textasciicircum}\{-15\}\$ and α = -0.45 ± 0.20, respectively (median and 68\% credible interval). For a spectral index of α = -2/3, corresponding to an isotropic background of GWs radiated by inspiraling supermassive black hole binaries, we recover an amplitude of \$A=\{2.04\}\_\{-0.22\}{\textasciicircum}\{+0.25\}{\textbackslash}times \{10\}{\textasciicircum}\{-15\}\$ . However, we demonstrate that the apparent signal strength is time-dependent, as the first half of our data set can be used to place an upper limit on A that is in tension with the inferred common-spectrum amplitude using the complete data set. We search for spatial correlations in the observations by hierarchically analyzing individual pulsar pairs, which also allows for significance validation through randomizing pulsar positions on the sky. For a process with α = -2/3, we measure spatial correlations consistent with a GWB, with an estimated false-alarm probability of p ≲ 0.02 (approx. 2σ). The long timing baselines of the PPTA and the access to southern pulsars will continue to play an important role in the International Pulsar Timing Array.},
